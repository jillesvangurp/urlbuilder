# Introduction

UrlBuilder is a simple Java builder class to construct urls. This class is useful when you have a base uri and need to create urls with things appended to this url or query parameters added to the url. It's a simple problem but one of those things where you end up with a lot of boiler plate code. After migrating this class between projects, I decided to put it up on Github for reuse.

# Installation

It's a maven project. So, checking it out and doing a mvn clean install should do the trick.

Alternatively, you can exercise your rights under the license and simply copy and adapt. The [license](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/urlbuilder/blob/master/LICENSE) allows you to do this and I have no problems with this.

If you like to use pre-built jars, you can utilize my private maven repository as explained [here](http://www.jillesvangurp.com/2013/02/27/maven-and-my-github-projects/)

Should anyone like this licensed differently, please contact me.

If anyone wants to fix stuff just send me a pull request.
